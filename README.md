# Web Style Guide

In this project I'm provided a completed website written with HTML and CSS. From those file I did:

- Convert CSS into Sass by splitting the provided code into several Sass partial files.
- Look for repeated values throughout the CSS and store them in Sass variables.
- Write and use a media query mixin to use with all media queries.
- Use nested selectors.
- Write and use a Sass function to create a hover effect.
